# dot-emacs-dot-d
Yet another personal `.emacs.d/` setup

## setup
There are many ways to setup
1. Use the repository for `.emacs.d` directly.
2. Symlink the repository to `.emacs.d`.
3. Put the repository anywhere.
   - run the script [`cwdemacs`](cwdemacs) to test;
   - `cwdemacs` sets `$HOME` to the repository and
     uses `$HOME/.emacs.d` that symlinks the repository itself;
